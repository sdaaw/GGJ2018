Global Game Jam 2018 


In order to make your own stories, adjectives, objects, names, etc. you can find a bunch of .txt files in the SharedAssets folder.

These .txt files use a very eerie formating.

```
!lastname! displays the lastname of the random generated suspect
!firstname! displays the first name of the random generated suspect
!fAdj! displays a random forming adjective
!dAdj! displays a random denominal adjective
!obj! displays a random object
!goodverb! displays a good verb
!badverb! displays a BAD verb D:<

#stage_1# adding this at the start of your story will set this story to be displayed at stage 1(in the beginning). Increasing the number will obviously show the story once you progress in the game

#0xFFFFFFF will set the color of the NEXT word
```
